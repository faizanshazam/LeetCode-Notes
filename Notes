Q 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum
>> Sliding Window can be used. Make sure you reset left and right once right hits end for one particular left.
>> Sliding windows can be thought of prefix sum problem
  >> This is because sum(0:i) - sum(0:i-k) = sum of window (k:i) = sum to be found
  >> Adding map here will help immencely since sum (0:i) - sum to be found = sum (0: i-k) = sum which was already seen.
  >> map[sum]++ will create index of sum then add value to it as well if sum doesn't exists or sumply increement if exists

Q2. Add Two Numbers (LinkedList)
>> if l1 or l2 length differ then no need to break the code and do for left over longer path
>> use ternary operator 
>> make sure you take care of last extra carry which could come even with all nodes are explored 
  so better loop with carry in condition to run extra
>> OR condition in while helps a lot
while( l1 || l2 || carry)
        {
            sum = ((l1)? l1->val : 0) + ((l2) ? l2->val : 0) + carry;   

Q4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
>> Median of stream of numbers coming using min heap and max heap
  >> ALGORITHM
      >> prioroty_queue<int, vec<int>, greater<int>> minheap;
      >> prioroty_queue<int, vec<int>> maxheap;
      >> first element should go into min heap if max heap is empty
      >> if maxheap is not empty and curr could go inside max heap then push in maxheap
          >> after pushing check if size diff between max and min heap is more than 1 so heapify
          >> remove from max top and push to min heap
     >> else push to min heap and same check of size if if min size > max heap size then heapify
  >> for traversing two vectors of diff size 

         while(i < num1.size() || j < num2.size())
        {
        //pick the element

            if( i< num1.size() && j < num2.size())
                curr = (num1[i] <= num2[j]) ? num1[i++] : num2[j++];
            else if (i >= num1.size())
                curr = num2[j++];
            else
                curr = num1[i++];

Q41. First Missing Positive
>> Best approach is placing the numbers at its correct position by swapping if
    ar[i] <=n and ar[i] >0 
    also ar[i] is not at its correct position
    after swapping do i-- for recheck till it reaches right postion
>> This is because as per question we can assume numbers should be from 1 - n
so if that the case then it will be placed at it correct position ie pos = ar[i] - 1
>> after arranging we can run from 1 to n and see the first number missing.

Q.525. Contiguous Array of equal 0 and 1
>>Contiguous or subarray = can perform prefix sum
>> Idea is faily simple, consider 0 as -1 and 1 as 1 create prefix sum of this.
>> if we encountered same number between 2 indices then it means number changes and
  came back to same value so inbetween number cancelled each other.
>> EDGE CASE: what if no number repeats then there will be case sum become zero somehwere
  so always consider those as well in your max distance logic.

Q Cycle sort : important when questions involvd 1-N numbers, find missing number if one duplicate.
>> Idea is failry simple, make sure current ele a[i] is at it correct index a[a[i]-1]
  >> if a[i] != a[a[i] -1] then swap the number and make sure your a[i] <=n for this to happen for index bounding condition
  >> create a loop from 1 to N and its to be expected that i+1 should be the value at a[i] after swap , the first time number differs the that i+1 is ans
>> or create a mark bit on the same number lets say 20bit and set it
  >> after you did this you can rerun a loop from 1 to N and first time 20th bit is not set is your i+1
